# Datadog-monitoring
# Monitoring AWS Resources with Datadog

This project demonstrates how to set up monitoring for AWS resources using Datadog, allowing you to gain insights into system performance and health.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to establish seamless integration between AWS and Datadog for effective monitoring and alerting.

## Steps

Follow these steps to set up the monitoring environment:

### 1. Create an AWS Account

Sign up for an AWS account if you don't have one. Set up an IAM user with the necessary permissions for Datadog integration.

### 2. Set Up Datadog Account

Sign up for a Datadog account if you don't have one. Obtain the Datadog API key for authentication.

### 3. Install Datadog Agent

Set up the Datadog Agent on the EC2 instances or servers you want to monitor.

### 4. Integrate Datadog with AWS

- In Datadog, navigate to Integrations and enable AWS integration.
- Provide AWS access credentials to allow Datadog to collect data.

### 5. Configure AWS Metrics Collection

Choose the AWS services and metrics you want to monitor (e.g., EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.).

### 6. Set Up Alerts

- Define alert thresholds for selected metrics in Datadog.
- Configure notification channels (e.g., email, Slack) for alerting.

### 7. Create Dashboards

Design custom dashboards in Datadog to visualize AWS performance data. Add graphs, charts, and widgets to display relevant metrics.

### 8. Test and Monitor

Generate activities or load on your AWS resources to trigger metric changes. Monitor the Datadog dashboard for real-time updates and alerts.

### 9. Optimize and Scale

- Analyze collected data to identify performance bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
- Adjust alert thresholds and dashboard layouts based on insights.

### 10. Documentation

- Document the setup steps, configurations, and any issues faced.
- Keep track of adjustments made to the monitoring setup.

### 11. Continuous Learning

- Stay updated on new AWS services and Datadog features.
- Explore advanced monitoring techniques and integrations.
